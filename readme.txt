You want some words, I got your words right here, pal!
Oh that wasn't enough words for you? You need moar words?! How many moar?!?!?!?!?!
I got all the time in the world to read from this dictionary. Every word you could ever need, want or desire I have right here on tap
What happens if I give you even more words? Can you handle this nimble linguist?
